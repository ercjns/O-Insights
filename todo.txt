Investigate index error when trying to load WIOL champs file

Clean up MVC implementation!
	Getters and setters in the right place
	Get the model out of the view!
	controller should do more.
	figure out loading warning messages from controller
	figure out if controller can ask for prompts from view to complete a task



Runner Object:
	implement "tags" for a runner to exist on a course in a specific category, but really just allow runner objects to exist as children of the event.



Plotting Classes / Module:
	Time behind leader
	Time lost per control
	Performance Index
	Bad/Good Controls (for an individual)
	Easy/Hard Controls (for a course)
