Runner Object:
	implement "tags" for a runner to exist on a course in a specific category, but really just allow runner objects to exist as children of the event.

GUI things:
	scraper - file load - some sort of error checking to figure out if we're going to be able to parse the file or not.


Plotting Classes / Module:
	Time behind leader
	Time lost per control
	Performance Index
	Bad/Good Controls (for an individual)
	Easy/Hard Controls (for a course)
